# TCP_Sliding_window_protocol
Implemented sliding window protocol vs stop and wait using c++ sockets. Then compared performance between the two when sending 1000 byte array to another client. 

Used C++ to implement the sliding window protocol/stop and wait, guaranteeing messages are passed over the network. 
Implemented "random" drops when sending messages to other client and the recovery methods involved when messages are dropped to ensure 
a message is sent properly.
